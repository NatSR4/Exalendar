# Exalendar
Exalendar is a calendar-website for hosting academic deadlines across classes for both students and professors. Exalendar helps centralize due dates for students in a single space. Professors add due dates for a course (exams, homeworks, etc.), and all students who are part of that course will have those dates marked on a calendar.

Refer to the [wiki space](https://github.com/NatSR4/Exalendar/wiki) for features, developer guides, and details on using the project.
