# Calendar HTML
<notes from KS about files in the Prototyping folder>

* Note that all text that is non-specific for now is placeholders
  * Placeholding text will be replaced once items can be added and agreed upon
* Colors will be changed and updated for more clean look after the basic html & css is mostly complete.
  * Color Pallete ideas will be figured later on. Completing the "feel" of the webpage requires:
    * Font (Chosen font can change the feel signifigantly)
    * Wanted Look
    * Icons
* Make sure to provide feedback and wants in the discord OR google doc

### Near Future Plan List:

* [ ] Ability to add events onto the calendar that can be represented visually
* [ ] Hovering over added events to see fuller description
* [ ] Right-Side display of current (or selected) day's events and priority tier. 
* [ ] Correct dates and month scrolling
