# Harshita Garg Spring 2021
This is just gonna be notes about what changes I've made and what needs to still be fixed.

## Main Page
### Changes
* will be fixing the footer up to be smaller and look better, I'm changing the height from 12% to a set value because it'd be weird if on a bigger screen the footer were gigantic
* linking the About link to the Exalendar Github Wiki for the time being
* changing font to Roboto bc it has more weight options (and everything looks default bolded with Secular One); Roboto has 100, 300, 400, 500, 700, and 900
* changing footer to be a little more like the one drawn out [here](../Drawing/Cal_2.PNG)
* put the footer styling into a separate css file so that other pages can use it, they just have to copy and paste the footer html code in after the body is done and link to footer.css and they should be good

### Thoughts
* i think the general rule of thumb for links is target _blank if it's an external link, otherwise keep it within the same tab? thoughts to think, i know there's some accessibility rules around this
