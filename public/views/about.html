		<h2>
            What is Exalendar?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Exalender is a web application intended to help students keep track of their deadlines, 
            exams, and other events in a convenient location. When it is completed, all events will 
            be displayed on a monthly calendar, similar to Google Calendar. However, as this planner 
            is primarily intended to keep track of academic-related events at RPI, it is possible to 
            automate the logging process for the user.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Adding Events   
        </h2>
        <p>
            All students can freely add events to their personal calendar. However, if the student is 
            enrolled in participating classes, the events associated with that class will be automatically 
            added to that student's calendar. Ideally, we hope to get enough professors or at least TAs participating 
            in this system such that there is a good chance that all significant events for a given student will 
            be present on their calendar without having to manually add an event
        </p>
        <h2>
            Not Just for Homework
        </h2>
        <p>
            Exalendar is flexible enough to support non-academic events as well. Whether you are a club officer 
            wanting to schedule an open house night or a group of students scheduling a study group, anyone can 
            create their own group. Once a group is created, the owner can create events associated with that group, 
            and any user subscribed to that group will have their calendar updated to include that event.
        </p>
