#### A – The Sidebar Menu - this was done in this way so that we could have more space to display the calendar and other features without having to worry about a lot of wasted or blank space, or the expansion of menus in the future.
  * A1 – This is the Sidebar Button: When the Sidebar is expanded, this closes the sidebar menu.
  *	A2 – The Exalendar Menu, this shoes basic menu items under a generic category

[Note that W is highlighted green for purposes of this image to quickly distinguish which calendar button is selected. In the real website there is no pressed button colors, I recommend this be changed in future updates.]

CH1 – The Days of the week are still displayed on the calendar in daily view, this should be removed in future versions

CH2 – The selected space should list hours of the current day, this should be red (same color as the currently selected date). This should divide the day into hourly slices with very thin lines going across each hour and at the same height for each hour on the currently selected day (When it is changed)
